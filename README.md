In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. In this challenge, I used Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and jupyter notebook to analyze, clean, and generated various tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study.
